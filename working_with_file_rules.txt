f = open("mytxt.txt" , 'r')
print(f.read())

# read() function return the content of mytxt.txt
# if you give int argument to read() function 
# it will return characters as many as you say for e.g. 

print(f.read(6))

# it will return 6 char which they didnt read yet 


# we use write() function for writing in file , whatchout the write functio
# do not put \n at the end of line so don't forget to put it there 
# 
# for example :  
# f = open("mytxt.txt" , 'w')
# line = hello to everybody :)
# f.write(line + '\n' )


# we using tell() function to find the index pointer 
# we use with for get rid of open and close the file and ... 

# we can not read big files like this : 

def csv_reader(path):
    file = open(path)
    result = file.read().split("\n")
    return result

# because they are really big so we can instead using generators : 

def csv_reader(path):
    with open(path) as file:
        for row in file:
            yield row
